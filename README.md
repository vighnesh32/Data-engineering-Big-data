# Data-engineering-Big-Data
##### 1. HDFS and LFS commands - This file contains the basic hdfs and lfs commands.
##### 2. Hive code 1 - This code creates a Hive database called "hive_1" and creates tables within it to store department and employee data. It also demonstrates loading data from both local and HDFS locations and working with array and map data types. The code includes examples of selecting and manipulating data within these data types using Hive's built-in functions. Overall, the code showcases basic operations in Hive for creating and working with structured data.
##### 3. Hive code 2 - This script creates a table from a CSV file, makes a backup of it, retrieves the table's details, and then creates another table with the same data in the Parquet format, which is optimized for big data processing.
##### 4. Hive code 3 - This code showcases various Hive commands used for creating tables, loading data, and performing queries. It demonstrates the creation of tables with different SerDe formats, loading data from local files, and downloading jar files for SerDe libraries. It also covers changing the number of reducers, creating partitioned tables with static and dynamic partitioning, and inserting data into partitioned tables. In summary, this code provides an overview of several essential Hive concepts, including table creation, data loading, partitioning, and query execution.
##### 5. Hive code 4 - This code contains a series of HiveQL statements demonstrating different features of Apache Hive. It includes commands for creating tables and loading data, adding UDFs written in Python, bucketing and joining tables using different techniques such as reduce-side join, map-side join, bucket map join, and sorted merge bucket map join. The code also includes comments describing the purpose and outcome of each command.
##### 6. Kafka code 1 - This file provides an data pipeline example using Confluent Cloud, which involves creating a Kafka cluster, configuring API keys, creating a topic, obtaining Schema Registry details, writing the Python code, and running the code. The Python code defines a Car class to hold data, a JSON schema for the Car data, methods to serialize and deserialize the Car objects, a producer that sends Car data to a Kafka topic, and a consumer that reads Car data from the same Kafka topic.
##### 7. Python code 1 - This code is a Python program that covers various concepts in Python programming such as variables and data types, operators, input/output, command line arguments, conditional statements (if-else and nested if-else), loops (for loop and while loop), and break and continue keywords. The program demonstrates the use of these concepts with examples and prints the results to the console. The comments in the code provide explanations of what each section of the code is doing.
##### 8. Python code 2 - This Python code demonstrates various concepts related to lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, strings, sorting, list comprehension, and functions.The program includes examples of creating, modifying, and accessing data from these data structures, along with sorting lists and using list comprehension to extract specific elements from a list.Additionally, the program showcases how to create and use functions with different types of arguments, including keyword arguments. Also, program showcasing lambda functions, map(), reduce(), filter(), and try & except. This code also includes the examples for OOP concepts such as class,object, encapsulation,inheritance and polymorphism,etc.
##### 9. SQL code 1 - The provided SQL commands create a database, create a table, insert data into the table, and demonstrate the use of integrity constraints. The commands also include examples of inserting incorrect data and the resulting constraint failures. The commands also demonstrate the use of aliases for constraint names. Finally, the SELECT command is used to query the data from the table.
##### 10. SQL code 2 - This is a set of SQL commands that create a database and tables, insert data into the tables, and perform various operations like modifying columns, adding constraints, and filtering data using SQL commands. It also includes examples of using the SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands to manipulate data in the tables. The commands are accompanied by comments explaining their purpose and function.
