# Big-Data
##### 1. HDFS and LFS commands - This file contains the basic hdfs and lfs commands.
##### 2. Hive code 1 - This code creates a Hive database called "hive_1" and creates tables within it to store department and employee data. It also demonstrates loading data from both local and HDFS locations and working with array and map data types. The code includes examples of selecting and manipulating data within these data types using Hive's built-in functions. Overall, the code showcases basic operations in Hive for creating and working with structured data.
##### 3. Hive code 2 - This script creates a table from a CSV file, makes a backup of it, retrieves the table's details, and then creates another table with the same data in the Parquet format, which is optimized for big data processing.
##### 4. Hive code 3 - This code showcases various Hive commands used for creating tables, loading data, and performing queries. It demonstrates the creation of tables with different SerDe formats, loading data from local files, and downloading jar files for SerDe libraries. It also covers changing the number of reducers, creating partitioned tables with static and dynamic partitioning, and inserting data into partitioned tables. In summary, this code provides an overview of several essential Hive concepts, including table creation, data loading, partitioning, and query execution.
